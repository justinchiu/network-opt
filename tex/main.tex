\section{Network Traffic Problem}
In this section, we consider the problem of optimizing network traffic.
A network is a graph $G = (V,E)$ with vertices $v_i\in V$ and edges
$e_{ij}\in E = V\times V$.
We would like to maximize the total traffic through a series of $K$ paths across the network.
A path is a sequence of edges $p_{st}^k = (e_{sv_1},e_{v_1v_2},\ldots,e_{v_mt})$
from source vertex $s$ to target vertex $t$.
A path contributes a constant amount of traffic $x_p$ to each included edge $e\in p$.
We denote the set of paths that pass through a particular edge by
$\pi(e) = \set{p \mid e \in p}$.
We additionally have the following constraints: traffic must be nonnegative $x_p \geq 0$,
and each edge has a capacity constraint that the total traffic on that
edge cannot exceed $\sum_{p\in\pi(e)} x_p \le c_e$.

This yields the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:network-opt}
\begin{aligned}
\textrm{maximize } \quad & \sum_{p} x_p \textrm{ or } \sum_{e} \sum_{p\in\pi(e)}x_{p}\\
\textrm{subject to } &\sum_{p\in\pi(e)}x_p \le c_e, \forall e\\
& x_p \geq 0, \forall p.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The first objective assigns equal weight to each path, while the second
objective weights paths based on length.
